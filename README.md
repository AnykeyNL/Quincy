# Quincy
Opensource software for the Landzo Quincy Drawing Robot Artist

# Goal
The Quincy robot artist comes with a set of cards that is can teach you to draw and speaks only one language. (in my case English). The robot program is run from an included Micro SD card. After my child drew gloves and a Squirrel he wanted to learn how to draw pokemons. As this is not build-in, he asked his dad (me) to hack his robot and teach it how to draw pokemons :-)

# SD Card
The included SD card seems to hold all the possible drawing objects and how each program runs. In the root folder is a version.txt, this file is in Chinese GB18030 encoding. I have included the english translation of this file in the repository.


# QRcode Cards
The cards have a QR code on them. The QR codes return: !A[object], !B[letter]000000, !B[number]000000

The object names directly refer to the folder name of the object on the SD Card.

Examples:
!Azebra00
!Amonkey0
!Astrawbe
